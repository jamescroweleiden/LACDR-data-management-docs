## Introduction
This is a guide to the minimum things you need to be doing for data management in LACDR. We'd like you to read and take notice of other information here
but following this guide will mean you are following the basic data management plan for LACDR.

## What does this guide cover?
This guide covers research data produced at LACDR. This includes raw data from an instrument, processed data, software and scripts, and any metadata needed to understand and use the other outputs

## 30 second guide
If you:
- Have a data management plan, and have sent it to the data steward
- Have all your data stored on a backed-up system
- Have a good naming convention and folder structure for your data
- know and have recorded a data owner and alternate contact, conditions of use/license, and retention period for your data
- Store your lab notes digitally
- Have a plan for how and what data you will release at the end of the project (or have already done so!)

Congratulations! you meet the LACDR minimum guidelines. We'd encourage you to read the guide for good data management at LACDR, and hope you can implement some of those steps

## Data management plan
All research projects should have a data management plan (DMP). Researchers should complete their own DMPs, and send on to 
Use Leidenâ€™s data management template [link], unless required by funding body (many bodies accept Leiden's template, so check)

Researchers should complete the DMP themselves to the best of their ability, and then send it to the data steward for review. 
The data steward will review, suggest edits, and refer any parts that involve sensitive data to a privacy officer.

Data management plans should be reviewed every six months, when research direction changes significantly, or when new data partners (for example, new researchers or collaborators) join the team.

## Data Storage

### Sensitive Data
This includes any personal identifiable information
You should have discussed with a privacy officer where the data should be stored, and be following that plan

### Other data 
Data should be stored on a system that is resilient and regularly backed up. If you're storing your data on any of these three systems, your data meets this:
 - The J: Drive
 - Omero
 - Surf Research Drive

 Other systems may work. talk to your data steward if we're missing one that is in use and meets this.
 
 ### Deciding what data to store
 We appreciate that biological data can be very large, and that there may be difficult decisions to make about what data to retain.
 
  we'd suggest:
  1) keep raw data, and ensure it is write protected
  2) keep the final, processed data
  3) keep a copy of the scripts or software used to process the data, along with a readme of what processing steps were preformed
  4) If the data processing took significant time, effort or resources, you may want to store intermediate steps alongside your final data

 If you are running into issues with dataset size or available storage space, please talk to your data steward. There may be additional resources to store your data, or strategies to explore.
 
 ### Naming conventions for files
When storing your data, you should have a naming convention for your files. We have recommendations here on how to structure this, but a basic naming convention might be
```Dataset_SampleID_Date```
We'd recommend putting date in year/month/day format

You also should have a clear and consistent folder structure for storing your data, ideally following the conventions in the rest of your group

 ### Retention periods for data
You should have a record of how long a dataset needs to be kept for, taking in to account funding and regulatory requirements

### Access to your data
Data should be accessible by your PI, who should be aware and agree to the scheme you are using. If you are a PI, you should have a nominated other person who has access

### Conditions of use/License
You should know and have a record of under what circumstances data can be used, any other people or organizations who should be consulted about release or other decisions relating to the data

## Lab book
Researchers should keep all lab notes digitally. Ideally these should be stored in an ELN or equivalent system, such as github for computational work, but if that is not possible, stored in sensibly named documents on one of the storage drives outlined above.

## Depositing data
- Assess at the start of the project what data you think you may be able to deposit, and where
- Plan what metadata to record for this, as each repository will have different standards
- Release the data with an appropriate licence [link]
- Use a repository that gives a persistent identifier
- Consider if your data would be better stored in a subject specific or a more generic data repository - https://www.re3data.org/ has a good search tool for subject specific data repositories.
- Talk to your data steward early about getting your data into a repository, to make sure you're collecting all the required metadata
