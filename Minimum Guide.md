## Introduction
This is a guide to the minimum things you need to be doing for data management in LACDR. We'd like you to read and take notice of other information here
but following this guide will mean you are following the basic data management plan for LACDR.

## 30 second guide
If you:
- Have all your data stored on a backed-up system
- Have a good naming convention and folder structure for your data
- know and have recorded a data owner and alternate contact, conditions of use/license, and retention period for your data
- Store your lab notes digitally
- Have a plan for how and what data you will release at the end of the project (or have already done so!)


Congratulations! you meet the LACDR minimum guidelines. We'd like to encourage you to read the guide for good data management at LACDR, and hope you can implement some of those steps



## Data Storage

### Sensitive Data
This includes any personal identifiable information
You should have discussed with a privacy officer where the data should be stored, and be following that plan


### Other data 
Data should be stored on a system that is resilient and regularly backed up. If you're storing your data on these three systems, your data meets this:
 - The J: Drive
 - Omero
 - Surf Research Drive


 Other systems may work! talk to your data steward if we're missing one that is in use and meets this.
 
 
### Naming conventions for files
When storing your data, you should have a naming convention for your files. We have recommendations here on how to structure this, but a basic naming convention might be
```Dataset_SampleID_Date```
We'd recommend putting date in year/month/day format


### Retention periods for data
You should have a record of how long a dataset needs to be kept for, taking in to account funding and regulatory requirements

### Access to your data
Data should be accessible by your PI, who should be aware and agree to the scheme you are using. If you are a PI, you should have a nominated other person who has access

### Conditions of use/License
You should know and have a record of under what circumstances data can be used, any other people or organizations who should be consulted about release or other decisions relating to the data

## Lab book
Researchers should keep all lab notes digitally. Ideally these should be stored in an ELN or equivalent system, such as github for computational work, but if that is not possible, stored in sensibly named documents on one of the storage drives outlined above.


## Depositing data
- Assess at the start of the project what data you think you may be able to deposit, and where
- Plan what metadata to record for this, as each repository will have different standards
